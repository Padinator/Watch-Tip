    "You can see blue points in 2D and 3D geometric figures. The white colour origins because of the edge of the points. Many points result in a huge white region. So with this you can see that all movies are in one huge \"group\". The rease for this is that a movie with genres \"Action\" and \"Sciene Fiction\" lays near to a movie with genres \"Action\" and \"Comedy\", which lays near to a movie with \"Comedy\" and \"Horror\". This means that you can go from one movie to the next, like it's a chain.\n",
