So with this you can see that all movies are in one huge \"group\". The rease for this is that a movie with genres \"Action\" and \"Sciene Fiction\" lays near to a movie with genres \"Action\" and \"Comedy\", which lays near to a movie with \"Comedy\" and \"Horror\". This means that you can go from one movie to the next, like it's a chain.\n",
